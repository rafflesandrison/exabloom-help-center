# WhatsApp Automation: Conditional Responder
Building on to our WhatsApp Automation: Auto Responder, we will now give the workflow the ability to send different responses based on the reply sent by the receiver.

Currently, here is the message sent out by the Auto Responder:

    Thank you for reaching out to Kay Eff See.

    Please let us know how we can help you !

    1 - Find out about pricing
    2 - Speak to agent directly

    Reply *1* or *2*

_Note: We wrapped asterisk (*) around the digit to make it bold when shown on WhatsApp_

After this message is received by the receiver, they will either respond with 1 or 2:
- If the receiver respond with 1, we want to send them the pricing detail for the products we offer.
- If the receiver respond with 2, we want to send an acknowledgement message to their request and immediately inform our internal team via email or WhatsApp.

We call this behavior --- conditional response.

To build this behavior of responding conditionally to different responses received, we will need to use these three additional Actions:
- Wait
- If Else
- Send Internal Notification


Enough theory, let's get our hands dirty and start building ðŸ¤“
