# Clean Up Test Data
We need to remove the contact from the workflow after our test.


### Step 1: Go to your workflow

Go to your workflow. 

If you see the contact icon appearing in the workflow, it means that the system is currently waiting 
for the contact to perform the action at the position where it is at.

In the above example, the system is waiting for the contact to reply to the message from action "WhatsApp: Auto-Reply".

Click on the contact icon.

### Step 2: Remove contact from action

Clicking on the contact icon opens up the Action Statistics. Here, you can see the details of the contact.
