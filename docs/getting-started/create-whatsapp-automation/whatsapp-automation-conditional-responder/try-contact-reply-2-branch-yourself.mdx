# Try it yourself: Reply 2 Branch
Now that we have created a branch “Replied 1” that handles
the scenario whereby the contact replied 1. We are left with
one more branch “Replied 2” that is activated when contact
replied 2.

Before you move any further.
I encourage you to create the other branch all by yourself.

The steps to create the other branch is on the next page... 
don’t peek until you tried creating it yourself ! 😜
