# Tag your contact
Find your contact and tag them with `test-whatsapp`. We are tagging contact with `test-whatsapp` to prevent any accidental messaging from the WhatsApp Automation.

### Step 1: Start tagging your contact
![Start adding tag to contact](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/tag-your-contact/create-whatsapp-automation-find-contact-to-add-tag-to.png)
Go to Contacts page and search for your contact using the search bar.

Once you've found your contact, tick the checkbox for that contact.

Once you've ticked the checkbox, click "Add tag" button.

### Step 2: Add tag to contact
![Fill in add tag form](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/tag-your-contact/create-whatsapp-automation-add-tag-to-contact.png)
Add tag `test-whatsapp` in the `Tags` field. For the `Action` field, you can write a short description of your action - it can be anything.

Once filled, click "Add" button

### Step 3: Verify that the tag is added to your contact
![Tag added](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/tag-your-contact/create-whatsapp-automation-tag-added.png)
In Contacts page, the `test-whatsapp` tag will be shown under the `Tags` column for your contact. It will take a few seconds for the newly added tag to be reflected for the contact.

You have successfully added a tag to your contact! ðŸŽ‰
