# Set up workflow
Every automation is stored in Workflows page. We are going to start configuring our workflow with classic setup.

### Step 1: Create a workflow
![Start New Workflow](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/create-whatsapp-automation-auto-responder-navigate-to-workflow-creation.png)
Go to Workflows and click "+ New workflow"

### Step 2: Creating workflow from scratch
![Start New Workflow](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/create-whatsapp-automation-auto-responder-start-from-scratch.png)
Select "Start from scratch" and click "+ Create new workflow" button.

### Step 3: Change workflow name
![Start New Workflow](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/create-whatsapp-automation-auto-responder-change-workflow-name.png)
The first thing we always want to do is to give the workflow a meaningful name. Let's change it to "Demo: WhatsApp Automation"

### Step 4: Allow contact to enter this workflow multiple times
![Start New Workflow](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/create-whatsapp-automation-auto-responder-allow-multiple.png)
Click "Settings" tab and turn ON "Allow Multiple". When "Allow Multiple" is turned ON, a contact can enter this workflow more than once.

On the flip side, what if we turn OFF "Allow Multiple"? After a contact has entered this workflow, it can NEVER enter this workflow again.

In most cases, we will keep "Allow Multiple" turned ON.

### Step 5: Save your work 
![Start New Workflow](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/create-whatsapp-automation-auto-responder-after-initial-configuration-save.png)
At this stage, SAVE your workflow by clicking on "Save" button.

We highly recommend that you SAVE your workflow in between workflow changes rather than saving your entire workflow changes till the very end. This is to ensure that you don't lose your work.
