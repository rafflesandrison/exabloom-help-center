# Test Auto Responder
Now that you've completed your Auto Responder workflow, it is time to test it out.

For the contact tagged with `test-whatsapp`, get them to send a WhatsApp message to the WhatsApp that is connected to ExaBloom.

ExaBloom will automatically respond once a message is received from any contact that is tagged is `test-whatsapp`.

### Let's start testing
![Verify Auto Responder Chat Breakdown](/img/tutorial/getting-started/create-whatsapp-automation/whatsapp-automation-auto-responder/verify-auto-responder-chat-breakdown.png)
Using the contact's WhatsApp, I send a test message (labelled "A" in the screenshot above).

Notice that ExaBloom automatically sends a response (labelled "B").

In response to message "B", the contact replied with "C".

As of this stage, we have confirmed that the WhatsApp auto responder is working!  ðŸ¥³

But ... it is not complete yet ðŸ¤¨

Notice that message "D" is being sent out after the contact replied with "C". 

We do not want this behaviour.

We'll learn how to prevent unwanted response as we refine our workflow.
