# Introduction
In this guide, you'll learn how to create a simple WhatsApp Automation that automatically sends a standard message to 
any client (who are tagged with `test-whatsapp`) who sends you a WhatsApp message.

We will be creating this automation using the workflow builder.

To illustrate what we will be building, let's look at the concerete example using the chat exchange between a customer
and a F&B business "Kay Eff See".

Customer:

    helloo, I saw your website about this chicken wing that is on sale.
    
    May I know how much is it?


Business (Kay Eff See) automatically sends this message:

    Thank you for reaching out to Kay Eff See.

    Please let us know how we can help you !

    1 - Find out about pricing
    2 - Speak to agent directly

    Reply *1* or *2*

The automation from such simple example will set the foundation for future workflow (a.k.a. automation) creation.

Let's starting building ðŸ¦¾
