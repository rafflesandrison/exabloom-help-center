In the chat window, you should see your message. To verify whether it is successfully sent to the recipient, check that the timestamp is shown below the message. 
If timestamp is not shown (i.e. "Pending" is shown instead), the message failed to send.

In the screenshot above, the message is successfully sent because there is a timestamp (11:23) shown below the message.
